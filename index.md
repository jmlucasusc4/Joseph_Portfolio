# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/jmlucasusc4/LinearRegressionProject/blob/main/Seoul_Bike_Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>
**Tools used** - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, linear regression

**Project objective** 

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

**Project outcomes**
46% Accuracy in rental bike count.

[Diagnosis of Bank Marketing Campaign using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/jmlucasusc4/LogisticRegression/blob/main/Bank_Logistic_RegressionProject.ipynb)

<img src="images/Bank_data.jpeg?raw=true"/>
**Tools used** - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, logistic regression

**Project objective** 

- Used logistic regression to identify a customer will opt for term deposit or not 
- Classified outputs as yes or no by studying patterns in measured attributes of those customer response
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to bank data and find the prediction of Y

**Project outcomes**
90.6% Accuracy in UCI BANK Data.

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/jmlucasusc4/KNN_NB_Project/blob/main/04_Knn_Nb_Project_ipynb.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>
**Tools used** - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, KNN and Naive Bayes

**Project objective** 

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Used the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

**Project outcomes**
Accuracy of the KNN is 85.05%.
Accuracy of the NB is 82.26%
